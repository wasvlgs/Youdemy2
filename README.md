# Youdemy Project 

Youdemy is an innovative e-learning platform designed to transform the way students and educators interact with online education. The platform offers a comprehensive system that allows users to browse, create, and manage courses, ensuring a highly personalized and interactive learning experience.


# üöÄ README - Final Study Project: Backend Development for an Online Learning Platform
## Project Overview

This project is a back-end development solution for a modern and interactive e-learning platform. Built with PHP (OOP), the platform provides modularity, clarity, and extensibility. It offers a seamless learning experience for students, teachers, and administrators, with robust features and a clean, scalable architecture.

## Key Features
## Front Office
**For Visitors:**

- Browse the course catalog with pagination.

- Search courses by keywords.

- Create an account and select a role (Student or Teacher).

**For Students:**

- Explore available courses in the catalog.

- Search and view course details.

- Enroll in courses after authentication.

- Access a personalized ‚ÄúMy Courses‚Äù section for enrolled courses.
**For Teachers:**

- Add new courses with details such as title, description, tags, and multimedia content.

- Manage courses (edit, delete, view enrollments).

- Access course statistics, such as student enrollments and engagement.

## Back Office
**For Administrators:**

- Validate teacher accounts.

- Manage users (activate, suspend, delete).

- Oversee content (courses, categories, tags).

- Insert multiple tags simultaneously for efficiency.

- View global statistics (e.g., most popular courses, top 3 teachers).

### Cross-Functional Features

Tag-based categorization of courses (many-to-many relationships).

Polymorphism implemented in methods for adding and displaying courses.

Authentication and authorization for secure access.

Role-based access control for tailored user experiences.

## üõ† Technical Requirements

**Backend:**

Native PHP using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Relational database (MySQL) with optimized relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

Sessions for user authentication and session management.

**Frontend:**

Responsive design using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (Vanilla).

Client-side validation with HTML5 and JavaScript to minimize server errors.

**Security:**

Server-side validation to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

Prepared SQL statements to mitigate SQL Injection risks.

Data input validation and sanitization.

**Architecture:**

Separation of concerns between business logic and presentation layer.

Use of reusable and modular PHP classes and methods.

**UML Diagrams:**

Use Case Diagram: Detailed user interactions.

Class Diagram: System structure and relationships.

**Advanced Features (Optional):**

Advanced search filters (e.g., category, tags, instructor).

Engagement statistics per course and category popularity.

Notification system for actions like teacher account validation or course enrollment.

Comments and reviews on courses.

Auto-generated certificates (PDF) for course completion.

## Competencies Demonstrated
**Problem-Solving**

Define the scope of a problem using an inductive approach to find tailored solutions.

Research and evaluate solutions systematically to choose the best fit for the context.

**Technical Skills**

Application of OOP principles for clean, maintainable code.

Advanced use of relational databases with normalized schemas.

Implementation of secure authentication and input validation processes.

**Communication and Presentation**
Present and synthesize project results effectively to stakeholders.

Justify technical decisions and architecture during code reviews.

### Project Context
**Scenario:** Development of a platform where students can access interactive and personalized learning materials, while teachers can create and manage content. The platform is designed to streamline learning and empower educators with modern tools for course delivery.

## Evaluation Criteria
**Code Quality**

Clear separation between business logic and presentation.

Use of OOP principles such as encapsulation and polymorphism.
